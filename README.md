# [My article](https://www.wired.com/story/iphone-16-supercycle/)

### My opinion:
I chose this article because it speaks about Apple's push for adding AI to their latest iPhone models and whether the hype surrounding AI will be enough to turn around declining sales and lengthening upgrade cycles. I don't find apple's AI features very compelling and I am interested to see if consumers decide to not upgrade, and if so, how Apple responds.
